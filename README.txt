The main files in the folder are

1. SAMPLE.py, which generates original marker pattern in standard position

2. CORTXb.py, which computes the boundary signals, extracts the coordinate system, and computes the angle that rotates the detected pattern to the original pattern in the standard position

3. SPTMAPb.py, which applies translation, rotation and resizing to each original marker pattern to generate test sample for classification

4. ARTMAPb.py, which classifies the detected pattern and retrieves the corresponding id.
